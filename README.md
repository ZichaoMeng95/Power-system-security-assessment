# Power-system-stability-assessment

## Research motivation and solutions<br>
Data-driven methods are faced with serious data imbalance problem when applied to Power system stability assessment (PSSA). Due to the high reliability of the power system, there are only a few unstable samples in the historical data, so it imposes ***big challenge*** on traditional PSSA classification methods:<br>
* Traditional PSSA classification methods, such as decision tree, SVM, generally perform poorly on imbalanced datasets, as they are designed to generalize from majority training dataset, which would pay less attention to rare cases. Consequently, test samples belonging to the minority category are misclassified more often than those belonging to the majority category.<br>

In order to realize the accurate fault location in multi-source distribution network by using fault data with small size and low completeness, there are the ***breif solutions*** showing as follows:<br>
*	**Convolution-transposed convolution network** ([CTN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8618415)) is adopted to establish the mapping from stable-state data to fault data to realize the estimation of fault conditions not collected in historical dataset. **Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks** ([AC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf)) based on CNN is proposed here which can effectively learn the distribution characteristics of real fault data and generate high quality samples of fault data in line with the actual situation, thus augmenting the dataset. <br>
*	In view of the extraordinary feature extraction ability of **CNN** on image recognition, time series signals of fault voltage and current acquired by PMU are stored as multi-dimensional arrays which are similar to the form of images and we leverage a CNN classifier to perform automatic feature extraction on them for locating fault. <br>

## My proposed methodology<br>
The architecture of fault location framework:<br>

![](https://github.com/ZichaoMeng95/Fault-location-in-distribution-network/blob/master/images/Fault%20location%20model%20in%20distribution%20network.png) 

The model can be divided in three parts:

* fault data estimation (constructed by CTN)
* fault data augmentation (constructed by AC-GAN)
* fault location classifier (constructed by CNN)

Firstly, incomplete dataset are input into CTN to get fault estimation dataset.
Secondly, the complete dataset is used as the real data Xreal for training AC-GAN. The augmentation dataset is generated by the trained AC-GAN generator under the specified category code c, and the total dataset is obtained by combining augmentation dataset and  complete dataset.<br>

If you are not familiar with **GAN**, there is the papper you [need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). 

## Model training strategy with transfer learning<br>
A parameter fine-tuning method based on steady-state data pre-training is leveraged to solve the over-fitting problem and speed up the training of the overall model. The breif steps are as follows:<br>
* Pre-training CTN
* Pre-training AC-GAN discriminator
* Parameter transfer for fault location classifier 
* Training process optimization through Batch Normalization

If you are not familiar with **transfer learning**, there is the papper you [need](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5288526). 

## Dataset<br>
* A standard IEEE 33 bus model is built in PSCAD/EMTDC for data acquisition:<br>

* The second harmonic signals of negative sequence voltage and current measured at bus 22 when two-phase short circuit occurs at bus 6 and transition resistance is 0.01Ohm during simulation time of 0.4s~0.7s:<br>

In this way, fault data and steady-state data under various operation conditions can be collected, and ensure there is **no intersection** between training samples and testing samples.<br>
