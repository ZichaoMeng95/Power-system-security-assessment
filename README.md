# Power-system-stability-assessment

## Research motivation and contributions<br>
Data-driven methods are faced with serious data imbalance problem when applied to Power system stability assessment (PSSA). Due to the high reliability of the power system, there are only a few unstable samples in the historical data, so it imposes ***big challenge*** on traditional PSSA classification methods:<br>
* Traditional PSSA classification methods, such as decision tree, SVM, generally perform poorly on imbalanced datasets, as they are designed to generalize from majority training dataset, which would pay less attention to rare cases. Consequently, test samples belonging to the minority category are misclassified more often than those belonging to the majority category.<br>

Aiming at the problem of data imbalance caused by the scarcity of small signal unstable samples in power system integrated with renewable energy, a novel PSSA approach is presented. The ***main contributions*** can be summarized as follows:<br>
*	**Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks** ([AC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf)) is proposed here which can effectively learn the distribution characteristics of real data and generate high quality small signal unstable samples in line with the actual situation, thus balancing the dataset. Training strategy including pre-training discriminator, parameter transplantation and batch normalization  is performed to stable and accelerate the training process of PSSA model. <br>

If you are not familiar with **GAN**, there is the papper you [need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). The structure of GAN is shown as:<br>

## My proposed methodology<br>
The architecture of fault location framework:<br>

The model can be divided in three parts:

* fault data estimation (constructed by CTN)
* fault data augmentation (constructed by AC-GAN)
* fault location classifier (constructed by CNN)

Firstly, incomplete dataset are input into CTN to get fault estimation dataset.
Secondly, the complete dataset is used as the real data Xreal for training AC-GAN. The augmentation dataset is generated by the trained AC-GAN generator under the specified category code c, and the total dataset is obtained by combining augmentation dataset and  complete dataset.<br>

## Model training strategy with transfer learning<br>
A parameter fine-tuning method based on steady-state data pre-training is leveraged to solve the over-fitting problem and speed up the training of the overall model. The breif steps are as follows:<br>
* Pre-training CTN
* Pre-training AC-GAN discriminator
* Parameter transfer for fault location classifier 
* Training process optimization through Batch Normalization

## Dataset<br>
* A standard IEEE 33 bus model is built in PSCAD/EMTDC for data acquisition:<br>

* The second harmonic signals of negative sequence voltage and current measured at bus 22 when two-phase short circuit occurs at bus 6 and transition resistance is 0.01Ohm during simulation time of 0.4s~0.7s:<br>

In this way, fault data and steady-state data under various operation conditions can be collected, and ensure there is **no intersection** between training samples and testing samples.<br>
